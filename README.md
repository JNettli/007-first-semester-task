* [OSM Generator](https://www.osm-generator.com/) for custom embeded map

## Introduction
I am a first year student at Noroff Vocational School studying Front-end Development and this is my submission for our first semester project. Our task is to create a science museum website that appeals both to kids and adults with kids. 

## How It's Made
I started out making a [roadmap]() for the project which I wanted to follow. 

First I created a low fidelity sketch in my notebook of how I wanted the general look of the index to look, and also wrote down a few ideas for the website.

Then I used Copilot and DALL-E 3 to create a logo for the project. This turned out to be of big help as the logo provided me with an idea of the color palette for the website as well.

It created the logo on the left side. I really liked the orange-ish and dark blue color scheme so I added a simple orange line between the logo and the museum name text which I liked a lot, and became a running theme throughout the website. 

We were given a .zip file with several images to use in the project, but I felt that the vision I had for the website required a bit more than what was provided so I turned once again to DALL-E 3 to fill out the blanks of my website.

I wanted to create a unique animation for every single page, but due to a personal event I simply didn't have the time to do so.

I knew from the start that what I at least wanted was an astronaut floating in space, which turned to two astronauts and a Newton's cradle.

## Reflection

I found the design aspect of this website to be more challenging than I initially thought. To create a website that appeals to children was not something I could easily find on the web, testing several pages like NRK's barnetv page, and a few flash game pages like 1001spill.no, but these just seemed like any other page just with more colors. I tried several different colors on my page but I settled on a white background with orange/dark blue themes as I felt too many colors or strong colors felt too tacky for me.

Thankfully I'll most likely work with designers that know these things better and I feel quite strong at turning a Figma file into working code. Due to the personal matter, I had less time than I first imagined so many of the ideas I had had to be deprioritized to fit in more of the required parts. 

Overall I think the project went quite well.
